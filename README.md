This Statamic add-on removes HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) from responses before they are sent to the browser, optimizing your website's output.

---

## Features

- Automatically strips all HTML comments from `text/html` responses.
- Lightweight middleware with minimal performance overhead.
- Seamlessly integrates with Statamic.

---

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require diffrentdigital/remove-html-comments
```

---

## Usage

Once installed, the add-on is automatically registered in your Statamic application. It runs as middleware for all routes in the `web` middleware group.

### How It Works

- The middleware processes all HTML responses.
- It identifies HTML comments using a regex pattern and removes them.

No additional configuration is required. ðŸŽ‰

---

## Performance Considerations

This add-on is designed to have minimal impact on performance. It only processes responses with the `Content-Type` header set to `text/html`.

### Profiling

If you experience any performance concerns, you can use Laravel Debugbar or other profiling tools to measure middleware execution time.
